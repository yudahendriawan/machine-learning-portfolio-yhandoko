# Machine Learning Portfolio
Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio repository! This repository showcases a collection of projects I have worked on, demonstrating my skills and experience in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis. Below is the list of projects included in this repository:

## Project List

### Classify Alzheimerâ€™s disease (normal and AD) of the ADNI brain data using Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT)
This project aims to classify Alzheimer's disease (normal vs. AD) using the Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) on ADNI brain data. This project concludes that the Convolutional Vision Transformer can effectively perform image classification on the ADNI brain data. However, improvements are needed in this architecture to enhance the model's generalization and robustness. The accuracy of the test data was 66.26%, which is lower than the 74.1% accuracy of the validation data, indicating slight overfitting in this experiment.

### CNN Image Classification - Aksara Jawa

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify Javanese script (Aksara Jawa).

### CNN Image Classification - Dog Emotion with Data Augmentation Strategy

A CNN model designed to classify different dog emotions, incorporating advanced data augmentation techniques.

### CNN Image Classification - Traffic Sign Model

A CNN-based model for classifying various traffic signs to support autonomous driving systems.

### Predictive Analysis with CRISP-DM Methods

A project demonstrating predictive analysis using the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology.

### Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using IndoNLU Datasets

A deep learning-based sentiment analysis project utilizing the IndoNLU datasets for Indonesian language processing.

### Sentiment Analysis using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with IndoNLU Dataset

A sentiment analysis project leveraging SVM and IndoNLU datasets to classify sentiments in the Indonesian language.




### How to Explore the Projects
Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:

- Code implementation
